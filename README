Requirements:
  -Python >= 2.6
  -Necessary git repos to watch
  -SSH key & username with access to git repo
  -'git fetch' should work on that repo (ssh-agent, etc. etc.)


3. Copy gerrit_reviewer.json.example to gerrit_reviewer.json and set the values
4. python gerrit2.py CONFIGJSONFILE


To Run:
gerrit_review.sh => Will run the reviewer in an infinite loop.  Stays in foreground
daemon_gerritreview.sh => Runs gerrit_review with nohup and places it in the background.  Run it will the kill argument to properly kill the reviewer
  - Using the script's kill argument is preferred since it uses the group process ID.  Otherwise, the infinite loop will be killed but no the python script.

Note: By default, gerrit_review.sh will use python2.6 to run the script.  If you'd like ot run it with a different python executable,
  set the environment variable $PYTHON_EXEC:
     ~ $> PYTHON_EXEC=python2.7 ./daemon_gerritreview.sh
